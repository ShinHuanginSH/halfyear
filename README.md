# Half Year of us 
This website records the memories during the half year, full of love and laugh. 
I am sorry I finish this in 7th Month, but lovely, my babe does not blame me for this.

Thank you my babe for coming into my life, thank her mother for giving birth to her, and thank GOD for arranging this.  
There are three things I loved--the sun, the moon and you. The sun is for the day, the moon is for the night, and you are forever.
Hope we can hold each other's hands and continue forever, we ever struggled and fought though.

Hope you enjoy this
Love you
